# 🚀 React Developer Journey – Udemy Course Progress

Welcome to my personal implementation and learning log for the Udemy course:
**[React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. React Router & Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/?couponCode=ST7MT290425G4)**  
by **Maximilian Schwarzmüller**.

This repository documents my learning progress, hands-on solutions, and personal improvements as I deepen my expertise in React.js and modern front-end development.

## 🎯 Why This Repository?

I'm building this repo to:

- ✅ Practice **React fundamentals and advanced concepts**
- ✅ Write **clean, testable, component-based code**
- ✅ Track my growth section by section
- ✅ Showcase my skills to future employers and collaborators

This is **not just a copy** of the course — I actively work on each section, improve the code, and document what I’ve learned.

## 🧾 Notes on Original Code

This repository is a **fork** of the official course code. I include some untouched sections to ensure structure and reference are preserved.
I’ve also added Markdown `(.md)` notes in certain sections to document key concepts and personal learnings throughout the course.

**Disclaimer:** No direct instructor solutions are shared here. Any original code is marked clearly and remains unchanged unless modified by me for learning.
